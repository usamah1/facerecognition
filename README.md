# Face Recognition based Attendance using MATLAB

Face Recognition based Attendance using MATLAB



- In this project we design an Automated Attendance marking system with the help of facial recognition owing
to the difficulty in the manual as well as other traditional means of attendance system. 

- Machine learning-based supervised learning model by using Local Binary
Patterns (LBP) and ECOC (Error-correcting output code) classification techniques in MATLAB.

- The model extracts only very relevant features of a personâ€™s face through the viola-jones algorithm
discarding all other features then matches with the database using neural networks, and the results
are obtained in excel sheets.

- This system uses viola jones algorithm to detect faces, LBP for feature extraction techniques, and
ECOC is used for error correction and for accurate results.

How it works: Camera captures the image of a classroom, The faces are detected and cropped, Cropped images
are processed using Eigen face recognition and LBP algorithm.

- The students whose faces are recognized are marked as present and the results are transferred to an excel sheet automatically
